"""
Lightweight IR-MAD baseline.

Source/provenance:
- Iteratively Reweighted Multivariate Alteration Detection (IR-MAD) is a
  classical canonical-correlation-based remote-sensing change detector
  associated with Nielsen's MAD/IR-MAD work.
- The mathematical idea is to find canonical variates between two multiband
  images, compute MAD variate differences, and iteratively reweight likely
  unchanged observations.

Project adaptation and caution:
- This file is a compact Sentinel-2 implementation with optional subsampling for
  large OSCD tiles. It is useful for comparison pressure and CCA intuition, but
  it should be formula-checked against Nielsen/reference implementations before
  making strong IR-MAD performance claims.
