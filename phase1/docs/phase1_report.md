## 1. High‑Level Goal & Role in the Overall Project

### 1.1 Overall research context

The full research project is about **disaster damage detection**. Eventually we
want robust, label‑efficient segmentation models for damage types and change
types, combining satellite imagery (Sentinel‑2, possibly Sentinel‑1, UAV, etc.)
and classical subspace/matrix methods.

**Phase 1** is intentionally narrow:

- Implement and understand **Difference‑Subspace (DS)** change detection on
  Sentinel‑2.
- Compare DS to **classical unsupervised baselines** (pixel differencing, CVA,
  PCA‑diff, Celik local PCA+k‑means, IR‑MAD).
- Use:
  - **OSCD (Onera Satellite Change Detection)** as the **labeled benchmark** to
    quantify performance (AUROC, F1, IoU, etc.).
  - **MultiSenGE S2** as an **unlabeled testbed** to visualize DS behavior on
    many real patches.

This phase does **not** train deep neural nets. Its outputs (continuous change
maps, DS scores, PCA‑diff maps) are meant to be **priors/inputs for Phase 2**,
where we will build segmentation/damage models.

---

## 2. Repository Layout (Phase 1)

  toolbox (PCA, subspace bases, canonical angles, etc.).

These are **read‑only references** for us, not part of Phase 1’s executable
pipeline.

## 3. Datasets

### 3.1 OSCD – Labeled Benchmark

- **Tiles:** 24 Sentinel‑2 locations.
- **Data:**
  - Pre and post Sentinel‑2 images, pre‑registered, 13 bands each.
  - Binary change masks (0 = no change, 255 or >0 = change).
- **Representation in code:**
  - Each city → `(X_pre, X_post, Y_change, valid_mask)`:
    - `X_*`: `(13, H, W)` float32.
    - `Y_change`: `(1, H, W)` uint8, values `{0,1}` after binarization.
    - `valid_mask`: `(H, W)` bool (NODATA handling).
- **Splits (encoded in `oscd_dataset.py`):**
  - Train: `beirut, bercy, bordeaux, cupertino, hongkong, mumbai,
             nantes, paris, pisa, rennes, saclay_e`.
  - Test:  `brasilia, chongqing, dubai, lasvegas, milano, montpellier,
             norcia, rio, saclay_w, valencia`.
  - Val: configurable subset of train (`val_cities` or `val_from_train` in
    `configs/oscd_default.yaml`).

**Ground truth masks:**

- Paths like:
  - `data/OSCD/onera_satellite_change_detection dataset__train_labels/<city>/cm/`
  - `data/OSCD/onera_satellite_change_detection dataset__test_labels/<city>/cm/`
- Each directory usually contains:
  - `cm.png` – mask with 0 background and 255 change.
  - `<city>-cm.tif` – alternative TIFF mask.
- Loader `_load_mask` prefers the PNG, falls back to TIFF, and binarizes via
  `(mask > 0)`.

### 3.2 MultiSenGE S2 – Unlabeled Testbed

- ~8k multi‑temporal S2 patches (256×256) over Grand‑Est.
- We use S2 L2A only (S1 ignored in Phase 1).
- Each patch has multiple dates; we group them by tile/coords and then select
  pairs (or other sequences) for DS visualization.

**Representation:**

- Each patch path encodes tile, date, and offsets (e.g.
  `31TFN_20200731_S2_4626_514.tif`).
- Loader groups by `(tile, x, y)` and sorts by date.
- Currently we use:
  - Pair strategy `earliest_latest` by default (first vs last date).
  - Alternatives supported: `adjacent`, `first_mid_last`.

---

## 4. Preprocessing & Normalization

### 4.1 Band order

- OSCD and MultiSenGE band orders are encoded in configs:
  - OSCD: `[B01, B02, B03, B04, B05, B06, B07, B08, B09, B10, B11, B12, B8A]`.
  - MultiSenGE (S2 only): `[B02, B03, B04, B05, B06, B07, B08, B8A, B11, B12]`.

### 4.2 NODATA & valid mask

- `build_valid_mask` in `preprocessing.py`:
  - NODATA value configurable (commonly 0).
  - `min_valid_bands` threshold: a pixel must have at least that many bands
    ≠ `nodata_value` to be considered valid.
- `apply_normalization`:
  - Computes valid_mask if not provided.
  - Normalizes only valid pixels and sets invalid to a fill value (0 by
    default) after normalization.

### 4.3 Bandwise z-score

- `fit_or_load_band_stats` in `oscd_dataset.py`:
  - On first use:
    - Scans OSCD train cities (pre & post), stacks all 13 bands, filters
      valid pixels.
    - Computes global per‑band mean/std and writes to
      `data/oscd_band_stats.json`.
  - Later runs:
    - Just load `BandStats` via `load_band_stats`.

- MultiSenGE:
  - Reuses OSCD stats but reindexes them from OSCD’s 13‑band order to
    MultiSenGE’s 10‑band order via a helper.

### 4.4 Reshaping

- `vectorize_cube` / `devectorize_cube` convert:
  - `(C,H,W)` ↔ `(C,N)` (C=d bands, N=H×W), tracking valid pixel indices so
    we can project back to the full image grid.

---

## 5. DS Theory & Implementation

### 5.1 Subspace construction

For a given tile:

- Let `X1, X2 ∈ R^{d×n}` be normalized spectral matrices (d=13 bands), columns
  are pixel vectors at times `t1` and `t2`. We center/standardize bands via the
  global z‑score stats.
- We fit PCA bases:

  ```python
  phi_basis = fit_pca_basis(X1, rank=rank_r or variance_threshold)
  psi_basis = fit_pca_basis(X2, rank=rank_r or variance_threshold)
  Φ = phi_basis.basis  # shape (d, r)
  Ψ = psi_basis.basis  # shape (d, r)
  ```
- fit_pca_basis is a sklearn‑PCA equivalent to the lab’s MATLAB
cvtPCA/cvtBasisVectorSVD:
    - It transposes to (n×d) for sklearn, centers internally, and uses either:
        - fixed rank rank, or
        - energy threshold variance_threshold (e.g. 0.95).

### 5.2 Difference subspace options
Let P_Φ = ΦΦᵀ, P_Ψ = ΨΨᵀ. Residual projectors: R_Φ = I−P_Φ,
R_Ψ = I−P_Ψ.

We support two DS constructions:

Option A – residual‑stacked (Phase 1 default)
In ds/pca_utils.py:
def difference_subspace(phi, psi):
    r_phi = residual_projector(phi)  # I - ΦΦᵀ
    r_psi = residual_projector(psi)  # I - ΨΨᵀ
    stacked = np.concatenate([r_psi @ phi, r_phi @ psi], axis=1)
    return orthonormalize(stacked)   # QR

Interpretation:

- R_ΨΦ = “part of Φ that sticks out of Ψ.”
- R_ΦΨ = “part of Ψ that sticks out of Φ.”
- The difference subspace is generated by these “difference pieces” bundled together and orthonormalized.

This is Option (a) in appendix_ds_math.tex.

Option B – eigen‑based (sum‑of‑projectors, paper/toolbox style)
In ds/pca_utils.py:

def difference_subspace_eig(phi, psi, eps=1e-6):
    P_phi = phi @ phi.T
    P_psi = psi @ psi.T
    G = P_phi + P_psi
    eigvals, eigvecs = np.linalg.eigh(G)
    idx = np.where((eigvals > eps) & (eigvals < 1.0 - eps))[0]
    if idx.size == 0:
        return difference_subspace(phi, psi)
    D = eigvecs[:, idx]
    return orthonormalize(D)

Interpretation:

- G = P_Φ + P_Ψ:
    - Eigenvalues near 2 → common subspace.
    - Eigenvalues in (0,1) → difference subspace (in one, not both).
    - Eigenvalues near 0 → outside both.
- This matches the generalized DS construction from the DS papers and from your seniors’ 3D shape DS code in reference_code/DS/utils.py.

We expose this via DSConfig.subspace_variant:

- residual (default): Option A.
- eig: Option B.

### 5.3 DS scores
Given a pixel pair (x1, x2) and difference subspace D:

- Projection energy (DS projection):

p = || Dᵀ (x2 − x1) ||².

- Cross‑residual (illumination‑robust):

r_cross = || R_Ψ x2 ||² + || R_Φ x1 ||².

Implementation:

- _compute_ds_matrix_scores in ds_scores.py:
    - Builds diff = X2 − X1.
    - Computes proj_coeff = Dᵀ diff and projection_energy = sum(proj_coeff²).
    - Computes cross_residual using residual_projector and cross_residual_energy.
We also support sliding‑window DS via sliding_window_ds, recomputing DS
locally on windows and aggregating (mean or max).

## 6. Baselines
All baselines operate on normalized S2 data, per tile.

- pixel_diff (L2 difference):

    - s_pix = ||x2 − x1||₂ across all bands.
    - We also visualize an RGB‑only diff in the OSCD summary figures (using
[B04,B03,B02]).

- cva (CVA):

    - Same magnitude as pixel_diff (we reuse the same L2 norm), but historically associated with particular thresholding practices. In our pipeline it passes through the same Otsu/global thresholding framework.

- pca_diff:

1. Build D = X2 − X1.
2.2PCA on D, rank S such that ~95% variance is retained.
3. Use magnitude of the projection onto top S PCs as the score.
4. Normalize per tile to [0,1].

- celik_pca_kmeans (Celik 2009):

    - For each pixel:
        - Extract h×h patch from difference image (or stacked bands).
        - Flatten and PCA to a low dimensional subspace (energy ≥ 0.9).
        - Run k‑means with k=2 over projected patch features.
        - The cluster with higher mean score is “change”.
    - Implementation:
        - Patch size (patch_size) and downsampling (downsample_max_side) are configurable to control runtime/memory. 
        - We found Celik can be heavy; downsampling and smaller patches are used for stability.

- ir_mad (IR‑MAD, stretch):

    - Iteratively reweighted canonical variates between X1, X2.
    - Computes MAD variates and reweights based on chi-square distances.
    - Implemented in baselines/ir_mad.py.
    - Disabled by default; when enabled, it tends to be slower and weaker than PCA‑diff/DS on OSCD.


## 7. Thresholding & Metrics

### 7.1 Thresholds
We do not use ground truth for per-tile thresholds (Otsu is purely
unsupervised). We use train labels only for global calibration.

- Otsu per tile (unsupervised):

    - Compute Otsu threshold on the score histogram per tile (on normalized scores).
    - Produces tile‑specific thresholds and masks.

- Global fixed threshold (train‑calibrated):
    - Search over t ∈ [0.05,0.95] with step 0.05.
    - For each method, pick t* that maximizes either IoU or F1 on train.
    - Apply t* to val/test; no leakage from val/test labels into calibration.
Optionally, a manual “fixed thresholds from YAML” mode can override grid search
if we decide to lock in thresholds.

### 7.2 Metrics
Per tile / per split:

- Binary metrics:
    - IoU, F1, Precision, Recall.
- Continuous:
    - AUROC of the raw scores vs GT labels.
- Efficiency:
    - Runtime per tile (approximate, aggregate per method).
Implementation:

- eval/metrics.py:

    - binary_metrics(pred, target, valid_mask) calculates TP/FP/FN/TN and derived metrics.
    - auroc_score(scores, target, valid_mask) uses sklearn metrics.

- run_oscd_eval.py:
    - Aggregates per‑city metrics into means per split/method.
    - Writes:
        - oscd_eval_results.json – full structure, including per‑tile “otsu” and “global” metrics.
        - oscd_eval_summary.csv – compressed view (AUROC/F1/IoU + runtimes).
        - run_metadata.json – config path, data root, output dir, CLI flags, git hash (if available).

## 8. Saving Change Maps
By default, the OSCD eval used to compute scores in memory only. We added an
option to save them per tile/method:

- Controlled by:

    - CLI: --save_change_maps, or
    - Config: output.save_change_maps: true in oscd_default.yaml.

- When enabled:

    - For each split (train,val,test), method, and city:
        - Save score map as .npy:
            - outputs/<run>/oscd_change_maps/{split}/{method}/{city}_score.npy
        - Save mask map as .png:
            - outputs/<run>/oscd_change_maps/{split}/{method}/{city}_mask.png
        - Mask PNG uses the global threshold for that method.

These can be used in Phase 2 as priors/inputs (e.g., joint with RGB bands or as
extra channels).

## 9. Visualization
### 9.1 OSCD Previews (quick‑look)
We created a few quick preview figures for individual cities (e.g.,
outputs/oscd_previews/beirut_preview.png) showing:

- Pre RGB
- DS projection map
- DS Otsu mask

These were for initial sanity checks.

### 9.2 OSCD Summary Figures (new consolidated view)
Script: eval/visualize_oscd_examples.py

Per city (train/val/test or selected subset), it generates a 3×3 panel:

1. Pre RGB (robust percentile scaling, masked; 13‑band S2 → B04/B03/B02).
2. Post RGB.
3. GT overlay on pre (red mask over RGB).
4. RGB diff (L2; B04,B03,B02 only, on normalized data).
5. Full-band diff (L2 over all 13 normalized bands).
6. DS projection map (normalized to [0,1]; current DS variant).
7. DS mask (Otsu), shown as a binary image.
8. PCA‑diff map (if available, normalized).
9. Metrics text (for DS) if an oscd_eval_results.json is provided.

Command example:
python -m phase1.eval.visualize_oscd_examples \
  --config phase1/configs/oscd_default.yaml \
  --oscd_root data/OSCD \
  --output_dir phase1/outputs/oscd_figs_all \
  --cities all \
  --metrics_json phase1/outputs/oscd_run/oscd_eval_results.json

These figures directly address the review request to “show the ground truth
alongside difference images and DS maps” and to compare naive diff vs DS.

### 9.3 MultiSenGE DS Maps
Script: eval/run_multisenge_viz.py

Per selected patch pair, saves:

- DS projection map (*_proj.png + *_proj.tif).
- DS cross‑residual map (*_cross.png + *_cross.tif).
- A log file listing patch IDs and dates.

These are used qualitatively to inspect DS behavior on a large variety of
unlabeled S2 scenes.

## 10. Results (OSCD – Example Test Split Summary)
Numbers are from representative runs; exact values may differ slightly as
config/flags change, but the relative ranking is stable.

### 10.1 Residual DS + baselines (fast priors run used for Phase 2)
From `phase1/outputs/oscd_saved_priors_fast/oscd_eval_summary.csv` (test split):

- ds_projection:
    - AUROC ≈ 0.755
    - F1 (Otsu) ≈ 0.275, IoU (Otsu) ≈ 0.178
    - F1 (global) ≈ 0.236, IoU (global) ≈ 0.142
- ds_cross_residual:
    - AUROC ≈ 0.556; F1/IoU much lower – weaker than projection.
- pixel_diff / cva:
    - AUROC ≈ 0.756
    - F1 (Otsu) ≈ 0.258, IoU ≈ 0.172
    - Global F1 ≈ 0.157, IoU ≈ 0.088
- pca_diff:
    - AUROC ≈ 0.813 (strongest baseline).
    - F1 (Otsu) ≈ 0.277, IoU ≈ 0.185.
    - Global F1 ≈ 0.235, IoU ≈ 0.144.
Note: this fast config disables Celik and IR‑MAD for runtime. To run the full classical suite,
use `phase1/configs/oscd_default.yaml` (much slower; includes sliding‑window DS and extra baselines).

### 10.1b Full classical suite (Celik + IR‑MAD + CVA)
From `phase1/outputs/oscd_saved_full/oscd_eval_summary.csv` (test split; `oscd_default.yaml` with `--no_window`):

- celik:
    - AUROC ≁E0.649
    - F1 (Otsu) ≁E0.226, IoU (Otsu) ≁E0.150
    - F1 (global) ≁E0.237, IoU (global) ≁E0.156
- ir_mad:
    - AUROC ≁E0.704
    - F1 (Otsu) ≁E0.113, IoU (Otsu) ≁E0.063
    - F1 (global) ≁E0.108, IoU (global) ≁E0.060
- cva:
    - Identical to `pixel_diff` in this repo (same continuous scores and metrics).

This expanded run also writes change maps to `phase1/outputs/oscd_saved_full/oscd_change_maps/...`,
which enables Phase 2 experiments that use Celik/IR‑MAD priors (E5/E6).

### 10.2 Eig vs residual DS (Option B vs Option A)
We evaluated the eigen‑based DS variant in two ways using
`configs/oscd_variant_eig.yaml`:

- **Matched settings to residual DS** (sliding window on, Celik and IR‑MAD enabled;
  outputs/oscd_eig_full):
    - test ds_projection (eig):
        - AUROC ≈ 0.62, F1(Otsu) ≈ 0.10, IoU(Otsu) ≈ 0.05.
    - Compared to residual DS (Section 10.1, outputs/oscd_run):
        - AUROC ≈ 0.75, F1(Otsu) ≈ 0.27, IoU(Otsu) ≈ 0.18.
    - In this like‑for‑like setting, the residual‑stacked DS clearly
      outperforms the eig‑based DS on OSCD.

- **Light eig‑DS variant** (no sliding window and Celik disabled;
  outputs/oscd_eig_nowindow):
    - ds_projection (eig) remains weaker than residual DS, but with
      lower runtime due to the simplified configuration.

Overall, while the eig formulation is theoretically equivalent to
residual DS in the idealized DS literature, our practical OSCD
implementation favors the residual‑stacked construction: it is more
stable and achieves higher AUROC/F1/IoU for this dataset.

## 11. “Naive pixel differencing vs DS” – Key Takeaways
From the summary figures (outputs/oscd_figs_all/) and metrics:

- RGB diff:

    - Intuitive but uses only 3 bands.
    - Works well when change is dominantly visible in RGB (e.g., strong contrast differences).
    - Sensitive to illumination / color balancing issues; ignores NIR/SWIR spectral differences.
- Full-band pixel diff:

    - Benefits from all 13 bands.
    - Captures changes in NIR/SWIR that RGB misses (vegetation, soil moisture, etc.).
    - Still treats each band equally and doesn’t exploit subspace structure.

- DS / PCA-diff:

    - Align better with GT in many OSCD tiles:
        - PCA‑diff has the highest AUROC overall.
        - DS projection is competitive with pixel diff and sometimes cleaner, especially in reducing noise/outliers.
    - They model structure in the spectral space:
        - DS uses subspaces and difference subspaces to focus on directions where the spectral manifolds changed.
        - PCA‑diff finds dominant directions of change in the difference image.
These visuals + metrics motivate why we move beyond naive RGB diff and why DS /
PCA‑diff are valuable for Phase 2.

## 12. How to Reproduce Phase 1

## 13. Phase 1 Status & Phase 2 Handoff
Status:

- DS and classical baselines are implemented and validated against OSCD.
- DS is implemented in both residual‑stacked and eig (paper/toolbox) forms.
- Metrics and visualizations are in place to illustrate:
        - How DS compares to naive diff, PCA‑diff, Celik, and IR‑MAD.
        - How DS behaves qualitatively on OSCD and MultiSenGE.

Handoff for Phase 2:

- Inputs available:
    - OSCD change maps (score + mask per method/tile).
    - DS, PCA‑diff, pixel diff maps on MultiSenGE S2.
- Phase 2 can:
    - Use DS/PCA‑diff as extra channels or priors for damage/change segmentation models.
    - Design SSC/temporal methods (e.g., geodesic DS, multi‑date DS acceleration) on top of the existing DS machinery.
    - Leverage the per‑tile figures and metrics as baseline performance/context.

This document should give Phase 2 (and any new assistant) enough context to
understand exactly what Phase 1 implemented, why, and how to build on top of it.
